We decided to make a programme helps us to solve different types of equations like linear quadratic and cubic equation and linear systems (2*2, 3*3 and 4*4).
Our program has 6 main function , every case has its function to solve its specific problem .
The program asks the user to input the coefficients of the equations and apply specific mathematical procedures on it and gives us results on the screen which are the solutions of the equation or the solutions of the system .
